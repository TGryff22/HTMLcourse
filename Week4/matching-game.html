<!--
Add a counter that shows how many attempts the player has made, and show them the count at the end of the game.

Use CSS to improve the appearance of the game.

When the game ends, show a button that will allow the player to restart the game.

Allow the user to choose how many additional faces are generated for each level, i.e. allow them to set the 
numberOfFaces variable (through a prompt or similar) at the beginning of the game. Alternatively, allow the user 
to choose a mode at the beginning of the game (e.g. Easy, Normal, Difficult) then set the numberOfFaces accordingly 
(e.g. 2 for easy, 5 for normal, 8 for difficult...)
